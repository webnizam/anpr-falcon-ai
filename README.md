<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Emotion Detection Application by Falcons.ai

In this project I wanted to test the capability of generating a full screen video background using the rear facing camera of my mobile device through a web browser. Then take certain stills of that live feed and save them to the device. This was all done using standard libraries for Bootstrap, Jquery, Javascript and CSS. The implementation was not very difficult or cumbersome at all.
